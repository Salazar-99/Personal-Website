# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website: gerardosalazar.com.


It's built using a standard Flask MVT style with blueprints and styled with Bootstrap.
My blog is hosted on a MongoDB database via Mongo Atlas.


I manage my blog with [Bookly](https://github.com/Salazar-99/Bookly), a REPL tool I built.
I host this site on my Vultr VPS via Docker.


The Flask app is served with Gunicorn and Nginx is used as a reverse-proxy.
