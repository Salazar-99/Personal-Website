# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website: gerardosalazar.com.
Although it currently consists of entirely static resources, I wrote it as a Flask app in case I want to add more to it
in the future. My website is hosted on a VPS I rent from Vultr with Gunicorn and Nginx. In a world of cloud and managed
web hosting I found it a worthwhile exercise to go through the process of deploying a web application on bare Linux myself. I mostly followed this tutorial: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04.
